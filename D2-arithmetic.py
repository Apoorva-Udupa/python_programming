You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D numpy array, updated. Add np_baseball and updated and print out the result.
You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms respectively). As a first step, create a numpy array with three values: 0.0254, 0.453592 and 1. Name this array conversion.
Multiply np_baseball with conversion and print out the result.'''
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# updated is available as 2D numpy array
print(updated)
# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball*conversion)
