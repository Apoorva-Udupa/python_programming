''' Python Datacamp numpy -->
Create a numpy array from the weight_lb list with the correct units. Multiply by 0.453592 to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting numpy array as np_weight_kg.
Use np_height_m and np_weight_kg to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:
 bmi = weight/(height*height)
Save the resulting numpy array as bmi.
Print out bmi. '''

# height_in and weight_lb are available as regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with metric units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight_lb with metric units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb)*0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi= np_weight_kg/(np_height_m**2)

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)
