''' Python datacamp matplotlib -->
print() the last item from both the year and the pop list to see what the predicted population for the year 2100 is. Use two print() functions.
Before you can start, you should import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. pyplot is a sub-package of matplotlib, hence the dot.
Use plt.plot() to build a line plot. year should be mapped on the horizontal axis, pop on the vertical axis. Don't forget to finish off with the show() function to actually display the plot.'''
# Print the last item from year and pop
print(year[-1])
print(pop[-1])


# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a line plot: year on the x-axis, pop on the y-axis
plt.plot(year,pop)

# Display the plot with plt.show()
plt.show()
