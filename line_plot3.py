Print the last item from both the list gdp_cap, and the list life_exp; it is information about Zimbabwe.
Build a line chart, with gdp_cap on the x-axis, and life_exp on the y-axis. Does it make sense to plot this data on a line plot?
Don't forget to finish off with a plt.show() command, to actually display the plot.'''
# Print the last item of gdp_cap and life_exp
print(gdp_cap)
print(life_exp)


# Make a line plot, gdp_cap on the x-axis, life_exp on the y-axis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(gdp_cap,life_exp)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
