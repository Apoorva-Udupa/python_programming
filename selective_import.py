Perform a selective import from the math package where you only import the radians function.
Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to dist. You can calculate this as r * phi, where r is the radius and phi is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the radians() function, which you just imported.
Print out dist.'''
# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians 

# Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist.
phi = math.radians(12)
dist = r*phi

# Print out dist
print(dist)
